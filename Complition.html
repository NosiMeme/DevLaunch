    <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Hackathon Winner:</strong> The TECH CORPS Hackathon is a 12-hour event where high school students team up to build mobile apps to solve real-world problems. It's a hands-on, creative, and collaborative experience designed to spark innovation and teach students new skills in technology. Students work with mentors, collaborate with peers, and compete for cash prizes. </li>
   <br>
    <li><strong>Codethon:</strong> A Codeathon is a collaborative event focused on computer science and problem-solving through coding. It's often a hybrid event where teams work together, sometimes in person, to develop a computer science solution to a real-world problem. Participants typically have a limited timeframe, like 3 weeks, to design and implement their solution, often presenting it virtually afterwards.  </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Drone club :</strong> The "Drone Club CoDrone" refers to the CoDrone EDU drone and its integration into educational settings, particularly for Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) programs and robotics clubs. The CoDrone EDU is a programmable drone designed for learning and competition, featuring sensors, programming capabilities (Blockly and Python), and a focus on STEM education.  </li>
